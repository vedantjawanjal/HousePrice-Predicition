**Repository Description:**

This repository contains the code for my House Price Prediction project. In this project, I used machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. The dataset used for training and testing the models is available in the repository. Additionally, you'll find the code for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

# House Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a variety of features including:
- Date
- Price
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Sqft Living
- Sqft Lot
- Floors
- Waterfront
- View
- Condition
- Sqft Above
- Sqft Basement
- Year Built
- Year Renovated
- Street
- City
- Statezip
- Country

## Project Structure
- **Notebook/**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **models/**: This directory contains saved trained models.
- **static/**: This directory contains css, images.
- **templates/**: This directory contains Html files.
- **deployment/**: This directory contains files related to model deployment.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data and the steps involved in the project.
5. Run the scripts app.py to run project in localhost.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the `Home/` directory. It contains information about house prices and various features related to the houses.

## Model
The model used for house price prediction is a Gradient Boosting Regressor. The trained model is saved in the `models/` directory.

## Deployment
The model can be deployed using the files available in the `deployment/` directory. Currently, the deployment is set up for GCP (Will add steps for Deployment of model into GCP)
